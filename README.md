GitHub Actions can be used in real-time to automate tasks in your software development workflow, typically triggered by specific events such as code pushes, pull requests, issue creation, or scheduled intervals.

Real-Time Use Cases of GitHub Actions
CI/CD Pipelines
Automatically build, test, and deploy your code every time a developer pushes a commit or opens a pull request.

Example: Run unit tests and deploy a web app to production after successful tests.

Pull Request Checks
Run linters, formatters, and security scans when a pull request is created or updated to ensure code quality in real time.

ChatOps & Notifications
Send notifications to Slack, Discord, or email when something happens (e.g., a failed build or a successful deployment).

Labeling and Auto Responses
Automatically label issues or PRs based on content, or respond with predefined messages.

Infrastructure Management
Use tools like Terraform or Ansible triggered by GitHub Actions to manage infrastructure in real time.

Dynamic Preview Environments
Spin up preview environments for each pull request using platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or Kubernetes.

Custom Workflows
For instance, run a script to sync repositories or clean up resources once a job is complete.

Example: Real-Time Testing on Push


name: CI Test

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
