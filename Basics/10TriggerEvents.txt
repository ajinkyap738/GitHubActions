In GitHub Actions, workflows are triggered by events that occur in your GitHub repository. These events are specified in the workflow YAML file using the on: keyword.

Here are some common events that can trigger a GitHub Actions workflow:

🔄 Code-based events:
push: Triggered when code is pushed to a branch.

pull_request: Triggered when a pull request is opened, synchronized (updated), reopened, or closed.

merge_group: For merge queues (used in GitHub's merge queue feature).

create: When a branch or tag is created.

delete: When a branch or tag is deleted.

📁 Tag and release events:
release: Triggered for GitHub Releases (published, edited, etc.).

workflow_dispatch: Manual trigger via the GitHub UI (with optional input parameters).

repository_dispatch: Triggered by an external API call to the GitHub API.

⏰ Scheduled events:
schedule: Runs on a cron-like schedule (e.g., every day at midnight).

📄 CI-specific or advanced events:
workflow_run: Triggered after another workflow completes.

workflow_call: Used to call one workflow from another.

check_run, check_suite: For CI integrations that report test/check results.

issue_comment: Triggered when a comment is made on an issue or PR.

issues, pull_request_review, pull_request_review_comment: PR and issue interactions.
