In GitHub Actions, you can run multiline commands within a run step using the pipe (|) syntax for block-style YAML strings.

✅ Example: Multiline shell script in a run step

jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run multiline shell commands
        run: |
          echo "Starting build..."
          mkdir -p output
          echo "Hello, World!" > output/hello.txt
          cat output/hello.txt
------------------------------------------------
Each line is treated like a shell command (bash by default on Linux runners).


⚠️ Notes
By default, Linux/macOS runners use bash; Windows uses PowerShell. You can override with shell: bash or shell: pwsh.

You can also use >> to append to files or redirect output.

Example with if and environment variables

- name: Set up environment
  run: |
    if [ "$GITHUB_REF" == "refs/heads/main" ]; then
      echo "On main branch"
    else
      echo "Not on main"
    fi
