In GitHub Actions, timeouts at the step and job levels are used to limit 
how long a step or job can run before it's forcibly terminated. This helps
 prevent stuck or runaway processes in your CI/CD workflows.

ðŸ”¹ Step-level Timeout
GitHub Actions does not natively support timeouts at the step level directly via YAML. 
However, you can simulate it by using shell commands like timeout (on Linux/macOS) or 
Start-Job with Wait-Job in PowerShell (on Windows).

Example (Linux):

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Long-running step with timeout
        run: timeout 30s ./your-script.sh

This kills the step if it runs longer than 30 seconds.

ðŸ”¹ Job-level Timeout
This is supported natively in GitHub Actions via the timeout-minutes 
keyword in a job definition.

Example:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 10  # This job will be terminated if it runs longer than 10 minutes
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
