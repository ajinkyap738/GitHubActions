In GitHub Actions, concurrency is a feature that controls the number
 of workflow runs that can run simultaneously or ensures that only one 
 job or workflow runs at a time for a given scope (like a branch or environment). 
 It helps prevent race conditions, reduces redundant work, and manages resource usage.

 Syntax

 concurrency:
  group: some-unique-identifier
  cancel-in-progress: true

===================================

Parameters
group: A string or expression that defines the concurrency group. 
Workflows with the same group value will be affected by the concurrency rules you set.

cancel-in-progress: When true, GitHub cancels any currently running job or 
workflow in the same concurrency group before starting a new one.

Example

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true


=============================================

This setup ensures that only one run of a specific workflow (github.workflow) on a 
specific branch (github.ref) runs at a time. If a new run is triggered, the old one is canceled.
