In GitHub Actions, each job runs in a separate runner, meaning they don't 
share a filesystem or environment by default. To share data between jobs, 
you need to use artifacts or outputs. Here's how you can do it:

✅ Option 1: Use Artifacts (for files/folders)
If you want to share files or directories (e.g., build results, config files), 
use actions/upload-artifact and actions/download-artifact.

jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Create file
        run: echo "Hello from Job 1" > message.txt

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: my-artifact
          path: message.txt

  job2:
    needs: job1
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Download artifact
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: my-artifact

      - name: Show content
        run: cat message.txt

✅ Option 2: Use Job Outputs (for small data like strings/values)
If you're just passing simple values (like version numbers, commit hashes), 
you can use outputs and set-output.

jobs:
  job1:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      myvalue: ${{ steps.step1.outputs.value }}
    steps:
      - id: step1
        run: echo "value=Hello from Job 1" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

  job2:
    needs: job1
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Use value
        run: echo "${{ needs.job1.outputs.myvalue }}"
