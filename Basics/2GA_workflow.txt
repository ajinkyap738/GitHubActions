A GitHub Actions workflow is an automated process set up in a GitHub repository that runs in response to specific events (like pushing code, opening pull requests, or scheduling tasks). It is defined in a .yml file inside the .github/workflows/ directory of your repository.

Basic Structure of a GitHub Actions Workflow

name: Example Workflow

on: [push, pull_request]  # Events that trigger the workflow

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Type of virtual machine to run on

    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '20'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
