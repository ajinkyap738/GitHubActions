In GitHub Actions, a matrix configuration is a powerful feature that allows 
you to run a single workflow job multiple times with different combinations of variables. 
It's typically used for testing across multiple environments, like different operating systems,
 language versions, or configurations.

ðŸ“˜ What Is Matrix Configuration?
A matrix lets you define a set of variables (e.g., os, node, python) 
and their possible values, and GitHub Actions will automatically create a job for every 
possible combination of those variables.

âœ… Common Use Case Example
Suppose you want to test your code on:

Node.js versions: 14, 16, 18

Operating systems: ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest

Here's how you'd use a matrix in your workflow:


name: Node.js CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
        node: [14, 16, 18]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test


This matrix creates 9 jobs (3 OSs Ã— 3 Node.js versions).

ðŸ”§ Advanced Matrix Features
Exclude combinations:

strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    node: [14, 16]
    exclude:
      - os: windows-latest
        node: 14

--------------------------------------------------------------

Include additional variables:

strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest]
    node: [16]
    include:
      - os: ubuntu-latest
        node: 16
        extra_flag: true
